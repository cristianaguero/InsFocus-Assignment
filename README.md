I utilized MockAPI to emulate the backend, containing information up to ID 10. 
The control flow syntax was used for error and validation management, as well as object iteration. 
Additionally, services have been implemented to facilitate the retrieval and sharing of data between components.
For sharing data between components, I used BehaviorSubject.
